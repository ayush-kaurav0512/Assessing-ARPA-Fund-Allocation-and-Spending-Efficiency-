# **ARPA Fund Allocation and Spending Efficiency Analysis**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project conducts a **structured financial analysis** of **$396M in ARPA funds** across **50 programs**, identifying cost variances and benchmarking allocation efficiency. Using **AI-driven analytics**, we uncover spending patterns, automate fund tracking, and present actionable recommendations through data visualizations.  

## 📊 **Key Insights & Findings**  
- **20% of programs** fully utilized their allocated budgets.  
- **Up to 30% underutilization** in several programs, leading to inefficiencies.  
- Identified **$122.6M (31%) in unspent funds**, highlighting gaps in fund distribution.  

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Data Processing:** SQL, ETL Pipelines  
- **AI & Analytics:** Machine Learning for pattern detection, AI-driven analytics  
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib  
- **Automation:** AI-based fund tracking  

## 📌 **Project Goals**  
✔️ Identify cost variances and spending inefficiencies  
✔️ Automate fund tracking for real-time monitoring  
✔️ Provide **data-driven recommendations** to optimize fund distribution  

## 📢 **Results & Recommendations**  
- Enhanced fund allocation strategies by identifying inefficiencies.  
- Provided **visual reports** to stakeholders for better decision-making.  
- Recommended **automated fund tracking** to improve real-time monitoring.
